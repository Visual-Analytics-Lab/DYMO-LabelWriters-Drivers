INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

I. Install Source Package
=========================

To compile and install source package you will need:
  - recent C++ compiler
  - installed CUPS *.h files (cups/cups.h, cups/raster.h)
  - installed CUPS libraries (libcups2-dev, libcupsimage2-dev)
  - installed Autotools (automake)

To compile sources run follow commands from the package directory:
./configure
make

To install compiled binaries and data files use command (you have to have root privileges):
make install

II. Known Problems
===================

1. Error message "CUPS modeldir <dir> is not existed..."

While running "configure" script tries to determine where CUPS is installed. 
For that it uses 'cups-config' utility if existed or uses default values for the dirs.
If CUPS is installed into different directories you might see the above error message.
To avoid it pass proper directories to "configure" script using environment variables, e.g.
$ cups_datadir='/usr/local/share/cups' cups_serverbindir='/usr/local/lib/cups' ./configure

Default directories for CUPS are '/usr/share/cups' and '/usr/lib/cups'
